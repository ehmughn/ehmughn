# 🧑 About Me:
> I'm currently studying Information Technology Student at NU Dasmariñas, aspiring to be a Full-Stack Developer, and maybe become a Game Developer if creativity isn't a limiting factor. I love playing video games and because of that, I learned programming through Minecraft (starting on minecraft redstone, then command blocks, then datapacks which is an indirect solution for Mojang to support mods for Minecraft Java, and then I have to learn C++ \[no particular reason why that language though\] to help me automate the creation of said datapacks). It served as a massive headstart in college, especially when dealing with programming challenges. Now, I am mastering my skills on graphic designs, and hopefully one day I can be confident at my artistic creations.
